/**
 * The scope has to survive DUPLICATE MODULE INSTANCES.
 *
 * Strapi boots the application from `dist/`, while `rooms:sync` imports the
 * same files from `src/` through ts-node. Both copies are loaded into one
 * process, so a plain module-level AsyncLocalStorage gives each copy its OWN
 * instance: the scope opened by the sync is then invisible to the guard, and
 * the guard rejects the very writes it is supposed to allow.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical — it is exactly what happened the first time the
 * sync ran against a real Strapi. These tests reproduce it by forcing a second
 * module instance through the require cache.
