import { AsyncLocalStorage } from 'node:async_hooks';

/**
 * Marks the narrow call path that is allowed to write catalogue-managed room
 * fields.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a global flag. A module-level boolean would be
 * switched on for the whole process and every concurrent request would inherit
 * it — exactly the "unsafe global bypass switch" this must not be. An
 * AsyncLocalStorage scope is bound to one asynchronous call tree: only code
 * that the sync itself invoked runs inside it, an admin-panel request never
 * does, and the scope disappears automatically when the sync returns.
 *
 * The AsyncLocalStorage INSTANCE is kept in the global symbol registry, which
 * is a different thing from a global flag: it carries no state of its own and
 * changes none of the semantics above. It is necessary because this file is
 * loaded twice in one process — Strapi boots the application from `dist/`
 * while `rooms:sync` imports the same sources through ts-node. With a
 * plain module-level instance each copy gets its own storage, the guard cannot
 * see the scope the sync opened, and it rejects exactly the writes it is meant
 * to allow. That is not theoretical: it is what happened on the first run
 * against a real Strapi, and test/catalog-scope.test.ts pins it down.
