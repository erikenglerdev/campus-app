/// Proves that the campus overview's `<defs>` + `<use>` construction is really
/// PAINTED, not merely tolerated.
///
/// The drawing places its trees, parking and assembly-point symbols through
/// local `<use xlink:href="#id">` fragments. A renderer that ignored them would
/// log nothing and throw nothing — the map would simply be missing most of its
/// furniture, and every other test would still pass. The only honest check is
/// to rasterise the asset and compare it with the same drawing stripped of
/// every `<use>`.
///
/// Deliberately a plain `test`, not `testWidgets`: rasterising inside the
/// widget binding hangs until the per-test timeout.
