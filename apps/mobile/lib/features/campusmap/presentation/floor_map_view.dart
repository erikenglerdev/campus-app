/// The zoomable floor plan.

/// The SVG is a bundled, generated asset — never anything fetched or
/// manipulated at runtime. The selection highlight is drawn as an overlay in
/// plan coordinates rather than by editing the SVG, which keeps the asset
/// immutable and the highlight themable.
///
/// The highlight deliberately uses THREE cues, not just colour: a thick
/// outline, a marker above the room, and a textual statement of the selection
/// outside the map (see [CampusMapScreen]).
///
/// Rooms are tappable. The hit test runs against the bundled geometry, not
/// against the SVG: the asset is a picture, and treating it as a document to
/// query would tie the app to how the generator happens to emit it.
