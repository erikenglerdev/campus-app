/// Which room a tap landed on.
///
/// A pure function on plan coordinates, deliberately kept out of the widget:
/// the geometry decides, and the rules below are far easier to get right — and
/// to keep right — as something a test can state directly.
///
/// [point] is in **plan units**, the same space [MapRoomGeometry.bounds] uses.
/// The caller converts from pixels and passes only the rooms of the floor that
/// is actually on screen; a room one storey up must never answer a tap.
///
/// [tolerance] extends the reach around a room, in plan units, so a room drawn
/// smaller than a fingertip stays usable. It must shrink as the map is zoomed
/// in — a finger then covers fewer plan units — which is the caller's job.
///
/// The rules, in order:
///
///  * a tap **inside** a room wins over any nearby one, however close;
///  * among rooms containing the point, the **smallest** wins, so a cupboard
///    drawn inside a hall is selectable at all;
///  * otherwise the **nearest** room within [tolerance] wins, so two neighbours
///    never both claim the same tap;
///  * nothing within reach means nothing is selected. Empty floor is a real
///    answer, not a reason to guess.
