///    every attempt, so a failed attempt is not retried on every rebuild.
///  - [readLastSuccessfulSync] is the "last updated" the user sees and is
///    written ONLY after a successful sync.
///
/// A failed or structurally invalid portal response must NEVER reach this store;
/// only a verified report is written, so the last good cache always survives.
