// The fixed vocabulary the canteen filter offers.
//
// These are the **API's** stable semantic keys, not the source's marker codes.
// The source publishes an undocumented namespace of its own (`A1`, `G!`, `52`)
// that mixes two dictionaries and can be renumbered at any time; the Campus API
// maps it once, centrally and under test, and delivers `traits` and
// `allergens`. Filtering on a code or on a German label here would mean
// hardcoding a foreign key list and hoping it never changes — on food, where
// somebody avoiding peanuts is trusting the answer.
//
// The list is deliberately **fixed**, not derived from the visible day: a
// filter that appears and disappears with the day's offer is impossible to
// rely on, and "no gluten" has to mean the same thing on a Tuesday as on a
// Friday.
