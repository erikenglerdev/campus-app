/// **[statusUrl] is a bearer credential.** It is the only way anyone reaches
/// this case, it authenticates nobody, and holding it is holding the case. It
/// is stored encrypted, sent only to the configured status endpoint, and never
/// logged, never put in a route, never shared, never reported. The same is true
/// of [receiptPdfUrl], which carries the same token.
///
/// What is kept here is the *submission*, not the *status*: the status endpoint
/// answers `Cache-Control: no-store`, so a response is held in memory for as
/// long as a screen shows it and is fetched again next time. Offline, the app
/// says it has no current status rather than presenting yesterday's as today's.
