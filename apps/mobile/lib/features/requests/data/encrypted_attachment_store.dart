/// Keeps draft attachments encrypted at rest.
///
/// The first version copied picked files into the app's documents directory as
/// plaintext. For a grocery list that would be fine; for a **student card** it
/// is not — the copy sits there for as long as the draft does, readable by
/// anything with access to the app's sandbox, and survives until someone
/// remembers to clean it up.
///
/// Here the bytes are base64-encoded into the app's encrypted box, whose AES
/// key lives only in the keychain/keystore. They come back into memory when a
/// submission needs them and are written to disk in the clear at no point —
/// so there is no temporary plaintext file for a crash to leave behind, and
/// nothing to forget to delete in a `finally`.
///
/// The user's **original file is never touched**: this store only ever owns
/// its own copy.
